For UnPlug 2.05 ["Clinic"]
=========================

Duplicate items should update "details" part of entry to UnPlug2SearchPage.results (then this result can be passed to .addDuplicate (rename .addDuplicate to .updateDetails)

Right-click popup on unplug_result widget (not needed as we have tooltip?)

Better object to send through search.js:_apply_rules_to_document() loop.
	This could contain a way of reading original target, so we can allow file:// links to be downloaded if it's the original target of the page

Tell people when menu config is applied next restart (not immediately).

More finely-grained optional/required attributes in UnPlug2Rules -- eg <if_re text="..." is optional, but should fail rule if it exists but is ""/error. -- name "failable"?


For UnPlug 2.1 ["Tokyo"]
========================

Rules documentation (needs more stable rules api)

Non-en-US locales

Add <playlist> ability

Migration-assistant - copy media player config, then UnPlug._prefs.resetBranch(old_settings_base)!

handle exotic types in <media> (mms://, rtsp://, ...)

Implement (media) players, with "search for media players" config

Write your own rules more easily

Clean up the <rule> element situation where some require the dynamic version of the page, and others require a re-downloaded version (for consistency: the dynamic version can be serialized in different ways; and t avoid flashblock, etc). Perhaps group into <dynamic> and <static> (or <serialized> and <redownloaded>; or something) on the root node.

For UnPlug 2.2 ["Sprawl"]
=========================

<each_amf_string>, <each_swf_string> + binary downloads + .mov files

Use web workers for evaluating <rule>s without DOM nodes (ie in <static>): https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_web_workers
